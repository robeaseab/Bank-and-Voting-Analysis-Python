# Python Bank and Voting Analysis 

#### 1: Financial Analysis
* In this project I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of an undisclosed company. 

* I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


* The final script both printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

#### 2. Election Analysis

* In this project I created a Python script for analyzing election results 
* I created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
* The final script both printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
